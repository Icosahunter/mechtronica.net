## Glossary

| Term                     | Definition |
| ------------------------ | ---------- |
| Attachment Component     | Commonly called attachments. Components which provide a mech with a particular capability. Attachments are always excess-draw, and can be placed in a mech's arm sections (as opposed to Infrastructure components). |
| Attachment Toolkit       | A mech attachment used for repairing other mechs. |
| Available Resources      | See Resources. The amount of each resource generated by your mech. |
| Components               | The parts that make a mech operate. Components are installed in slots in your mech's Frame. |
| Constant-draw Component  | See Component. Constant-draw components consume resources at all times, unlike Excess-draw components. |
| Disassembling            | Reducing a component into Spare Parts. |
| Excess Resources         | See Resources. The amount of each resource remaining for excess-draw components such as attachments. |
| Excess-draw Component    | See Component. Excess-draw components only consume resources when actively used. |
| Frame                    | Frames are the superstructure of a mech. You attach components to a frame to build your mech. They come in three sizes: light, standard, and heavy. |
| Fuel Tank                | Fuel Tanks store fuel to be consumed by your mech's Power Plant. |
| Garage                   | A garage is a place where you can tinker with your mech. |
| Heavy Frame              | See Frame. Heavy Frames are very slow, but have lots of component slots. |
| Infrastructure Component | Infrastructure components help a mech manage resources and operate effectively, but do not provide direct utility (as opposed to Attachment components) |
| Light Frame              | See Frame. Light Frames have the fewest components lots, but are generally much faster than Standard and Heavy Frames. |
| Mech Parameters          | Mech Parameters are the stats that describe your mech. This includes speed, height, weight, strength, and cargo capacity. |
| Maintenance Points (MP)  | A measure of how much repair work you can perform on a mech in a single turn. |
| Repairing Others         | Specifically during turn-based play, the act of repairing someone else's mech using an attachment toolkit. |
| Mechaneer Stats          | The stats that describe your mechaneer. This includes dexterity, strength, agility, diplomacy, intelligence, and perception. |
| Power                    | Power is the resource that gets your mech moving. It comes in three types: electrical, mechanical, and steam. |
| Power Plant              | Power Plants are components that consume fuel to provide your mech with Power. |
| Resources                | Power, Cooling, and CPU: the resources that your mech draws on to operate. |
| Salvaging                | Removing a component from a mech in the field. |
| Self-repair              | Specifically during turn-based play, the act of repairing your own mech using a toolkit. |
| Standard Frame           | See Frame. Standard Frames provide a fair number of component slots without sacrificing too much speed. |
| Spare Parts              | Bits and pieces used to repair mech components. |
| Toolkit                  | A set of hand tools used for repairing mechs. |
| Used Resources           | See Resources. The amount of each resource used by constant-draw components. |
