## Mechaneer Description

### Species
The first you will want to do is select a species. The Mechtronica universe only has one organic sapient species, humans, but there are a few robots to choose from as well if being human doesn't strike your fancy.

- **Human**: Humans are the only organic sapient species in the Ilythia system, originating from the planet Cheilos.
- **Servitor**: Servitors are, often humanoid, sapient robots created for specific duties. They are tailor made for their job so an assembly line servitor may have precision manipulators and advanced vision modules but look very robotic, whereas a receptionist servitor may look much more human and have advanced speech and human interaction processing.
- **Mechanoid**: Mechanoids are a relic of the Golden Age, highly advanced humanoid robots with tough plating, strong precision servos, and excellent technical skills. They were created primarily to be the companions of pioneers who traveled the Ilythia system, pushing the boundaries of civilization. During the Great War, Mechanoids were repurposed as soldiers, but since then the refined technologies to produce these rugged and intricate machines have been mostly lost, leaving the few that remain wandering the system.

### Planet of Origin
The next thing to think about would be what planet you were born and raised on. Different planets have different major industries and different cultures surrounding those industries and the unique challenges of the planet. Take a look at [Solar System]({{site.url}}/lore/solar-system) to get a better idea of what the different planets are like.
