## Components
A mech is exactly the sum of its parts. This page explains the details and stats of different mech parts and components, grouped by part type.

### Common Traits
Almost every part will have a few basic traits:

| Trait         | Explanation |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Manufacturer  | The in-game group that manufactures a part. |
| Model         | The part's model name as given by the manufacturer. |
| Description   | A short description of the item. Usually provides some information about the design or history of the part. |

{.table}

### Mech Frames
The **Frame** is the foundation of your mech. It provides the superstructure you'll attach your weapons and components to, as well as the moving parts and power distribution system. Each frame has some number of slots for installing components.

| Stat       | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Strength   | The maximum weight (in tons) a mech is rated to lift. |
| Speed      | How quickly a mech can maneuver. Determines how far you can move in one turn. |
| Weight     | The mech's weight (in tons). |
| Height     | The mech's height (in feet). |
| Power      | The amount of power used by the frame's moving parts. |
| Cooling    | The cooling provided by the frame. |
| Processing | The amount of processing used by the frame's sensors and electronics. |

{.table}

#### Classes: The Size vs Speed Tradeoff
Frames come in three basic sizes: **Light**, **Standard**, and **Heavy**. Frame size determines how many slots you have and your base speed. Smaller frames are hard to hit, but larger frames have more space for more firepower.

| Class     | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Light     | Light frames have little space for components, but tend to be fast and hard to hit. |
| Standard  | Standard frames provide a good balance between movement speed and space for components. |
| Heavy     | Heavy frames have loads of component slots, but are very slow as a result of their size. |

{.table}

#### Component Slots
Mech frames have a number of slots where other components are installed. Slots come in two standard sizes: small (S) and large (L). Some slots are more exposed than others, and therefore more likely to be hit. 

The number of slots in a frame depends on the frame class. 

| Stat       | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| ID         | Used to identify which slot a component is installed in. |
| Size       | The maximum component size which will fit in a slot. |
| Hit Values | The minimum and maximum range you have to roll when targeting in order to hit a particular slot. See [Combat]({{ site.url }}/rules/combat). |

{.table}

More details on component slots and mech frames can be found in [Placing Components]({{ site.url }}/rules/placing-components).

#### Plating
Plating protects components by absorbing damage dealt to a particular section. You should have plating on each section of your mech.

| Stat    | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Cooling | The cooling provided by the plating. |
| Shields | The amount of damage the plating can take before breaking. |
| Speed   | How much the plating slows down your mech. |
| Effect  | Special effects conferred by the plating. |

{.table}

### The Power Subsystem
The power subsystem consists of two components: a **Power Plant** and a **Fuel Tank**. The power plant uses fuel from the fuel tank to generate a steady supply of energy.

#### Power Plants
Power Plants convert fuel into power.

| Stat       | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Size       | The minimum slot size required to install this component. |
| Power Type | The type of power generated by this power plant. |
| Fuel Type  | The type of fuel that this power plant requires. |
| Power      | The amount of power generated by this power plant. |
| Cooling    | The amount of cooling that this component requires. |
| Processing | The amount of processing that this component requires. |

{.table}

##### Power Types
Each power plant supplies a specific type of power: either Mechanical, Electrical, or Steam power. Components must also be supplied with power of the correct type.

> Note: There are a few components that are not marked with a specific power type: namely Mainframes and Mech Frames. Mainframes use power supplied by your cabin, so they draw power of the same type as the Cabin. Frames are unique in that they can be reconfigured at a garage to use a different power type. See [Maintenance]({{ site.url }}/rules/maintenance) for more info on reconfiguring frames.
<!-- TODO: Make sure the maintenance page has info on this ^ -->

It is possible to [use multiple power plants]({{ site.url }}/rules/multiple-power-plants) with different types, but this typically isn't worth the amount of space it uses up. It is strongly recommended that you choose a single power plant and components that match the power type it supplies.

See [Planning]({{ site.url }}/rules/build-planning) for more information on how to choose a power type.

#### Fuel Tanks
Fuel tanks store fuel and supply it to the power plant. There are several different types of fuel, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. See [Planning]({{ site.url }}/rules/build-planning) for more details on fuel types and how to pick the right one for your mech.

| Stat      | Description                |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| Fuel Type | The type of fuel stored.   |
| Capacity  | The amount of fuel stored. |

{.table}

### The Control Subsystem
Mechs are controlled by a combination of mechaneer input and computer automation. The control subsystem consists of the Cabin, Mainframe, and Modules.

| Class      | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Efficiency | Efficiency-focused control components minimize size, power, and heat at the cost of lower processing capacity and fewer module slots. |
| Standard   | The Standard class focuses on balancing heat, power, and processing while also providing plenty of cargo space. |
| Combat     | Combat-focused control components prioritize maximum processing at the cost of higher heat output and power draw. Combat Mainframes also provide a bonus to targeting through dedicated aim point selection routines. |

{.table}

#### Software
In order to control your mech, your Cabin and Modules need to be compatible with the **Software** running on your Mainframe. There are three different types of Software, and each has distinct benefits.

| Software  | Class      | Advantages                                                          |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UMIX      | Efficiency | Very small, low power usage, but limited CPU production             |
| ProtOS    | Standard   | Well balanced, produces a moderate amount of CPU at reasonable cost |
| Ursa NT   | Combat     | Bonus to Targeting, lots of CPU and mod slots, but large and hot    |

{.table}

Many components are compatible with multiple types of software, but you can only run one type of software at a time on your Mainframe. Your Cabin and all Modules must be compatible with the software running on your Mainframe. You can change software at a Garage.

#### Cabins
Cabins provide mechaneers with all the necessary controls to pilot their mechs. They also usually have some slots for Modules and cargo.

| Stat         | Description |
| -------------| ----------- |
| Software     | The software this cabin is compatible with. |
| Size         | The minimum slot size required to install this component. |
| Power Type   | The type of power this component requires. |
| Power        | The amount of power this component requires. |
| Cooling      | The amount of cooling that this component requires. |
| Processsing  | The amount of processing that this component requires. |
| Module slots | The maximum number of Modules that can be installed in this cabin. |
| Cargo        | The maximum number of components that can be stored in the cabin's integrated storage. |

#### Mainframes
Mainframes provide mechs with Processing capacity.

#### Modules
Modules are special mech parts that use a small amount of processing in order to augment mech capabilites. They vary widely in effect, from providing combat advantages to cosmetic improvements. Modules are installed in Module slots in the Cabin.
