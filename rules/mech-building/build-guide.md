1. Develop a vision for your {% keyword 'Mechaneer' glossary %} and mech
    - Come up with a name and background for your mechaneer. See [Mechaneer Description]({{site.url}}/rules/mechaneer-description)
    - Roll stats. See [Mechaneer States]({{site.url}}/rules/mechaneer-stats)
    - Decide what you want to focus your mech on (combat, field repairs, science, etc.)
    - [Start developing a vision for your mech]({{site.url}}/rules/build-planning)
2. Choose a Frame
    - Smaller mechs are faster and often don't need auxiliary {% keyword 'Cooling' glossary %}
    - Larger mechs have extra slots for more firepower
    - Take a look at [Planning]({{site.url}}/rules/build-planning) for some important frame tradeoffs
    - Filter for Frames on [MechDB]({{site.url}}/mechdb/viewer) to view your options
3. Choose your mech's main Weapons and Equipment
    - Choose a {% keyword 'Power Type' glossary %} that lets you get most of the attachments you want
        - See [Planning]({{site.url}}/rules/build-planning) for some important considerations
    - Find attachments that fit your vision (and match your power type)
    - Learn more about [weapons]({{site.url}}/rules/weapons) and [equipment]({{site.url}}/rules/equipment)
    - Don't worry about filling all your slots here, just pick a couple must-haves
    - For information on how to place components in your mech's frame, see [Placing Components]({{site.url}}/rules/placing-components)
    - You can browse weapons and equipment on [MechDB]({{site.url}}/mechdb/viewer)
4. Add the control subsystem
    - Choose a mainframe that provides enough processing for the components you've selected so far, plus a bit extra to spare
        - See [Planning]({{site.url}}/rules/build-planning) for some important considerations on control software
    - Choose a cabin compatible with your mainframe's software
    - Filter for Mainframes on [MechDB]({{site.url}}/mechdb/viewer) to view options
5. Add the power subsystem
    - Choose a power plant that provides enough power for the components you've selected so far, plus a bit extra to spare
        - Also make sure it matches your power type
        - See [Planning]({{site.url}}/rules/build-planning) for some important considerations on fuel type and capacity
    - Choose a fuel tank that can supply your power plant with fuel
    - Browse Power Plants and Tanks on [MechDB]({{site.url}}/mechdb/viewer)
6. Check whether you need to add a cooler
    - If you just barely have enough excess cooling to use your attachments at this point, you probably need to add a cooler
    - Filter for Coolers on [MechDB]({{site.url}}/mechdb/viewer) to view options
7. Add more weapons and equipment
    - Fill in remaining slots in your mech with a few more attachments
    - Make sure any additional components match your power type
8. Add Modules to your Mainframe
    - Select modules that synergize with your mech's capabilities
    - Make sure any modules are compatible with your mech's software
    - Filter for Modules on [MechDB]({{site.url}}/mechdb/viewer) to view options
9. Check your resources and rebalance if needed
    - Compute Available, Used, and Excess resources for Power, Processing, and Cooling
    - If you don't have enough excess resources, consider upgrading infrastructure components or using less chonky weapons and equipment
