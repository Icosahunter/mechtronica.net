## Validating a Mech Build
When designing a mech it's easy to make a mistake as you are trying out different component options. For this reason, we've put together this short list of things you should double check once you're finished selecting components, to make sure you have a functional mech build.

### Component Placement
Double check that:
- You only have one cabin
- Only attachments (weapons and equipment) are in the arm and leg sections
- Large components are in large slots 

### Power Type
One of the first things you should check is {% keyword "Power Type" glossary %}. If you are doing a single power plant mech (or a multi-power plant mech but they all produce the same power type), then all your other components must match the power type of your power plant. For mechs with multiple power types see [Multiple Power Plants]({{site_url}}/rules/multiple-power-plants/).

### Software
Your cabin and all your modules must be compatible with the {% keyword "Software" glossary %} of your mainframe.

### Resources
To make sure you have enough resources check that:
- Your available resources is greater than your used resources
- Your left over excess resources is enough to use as many of your excess-draw components as you want to in a single turn

### Fixing and tuning your build
If at any point you realize you won't have enough resources to do something, or your stats are otherwise not as desired, you'll of course have to adjust what components you are using. Remember there's more than one way to adjust stats; often times modules and equipment provide alternative ways to adjust resource usage, speed, damage, or other stats and may be used to fine tune a build.
