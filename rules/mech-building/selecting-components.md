## Selecting Components
At this point you should have a basic idea of who your mechaneer is and how their mech should feel. Now it's time to dig into the details of choosing which components to use.

There are a huge selection of components with a variety of different uses. Selecting just a few parts to use can seem a bit overwhelming, but with a few key concepts in mind it shouldn't be too difficult.

### Basic Anatomy of a Mech Part

#### Part Types
The first thing to note about any part is its **Part Type**. Parts fall into different categories based on their function. For example, **Power Plants** provide **Power**, **Cabins** keep your mechaneer cozy, and **Weapons** are for blowing stuff up.

| Part Type    | Function    |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Frame        | The mech frame is the core superstructure of any mech. |
| Plating      | Plating protects a mech's components from damage. |
| Cabin        | Cabins are the center of command and control for a mech. Mechaneers pilot their mechs from inside the cabin.
| Mainframes   | A mech's mainframe computer provides CPU and interacts with Modules installed in the Cabin. |
| Modules      | Modules provide special functionality to a mech, typically at the cost of some CPU. There are a large variety of Modules with unique effects. |
| Power Plants | A mech's power plant generates Power by using up some sort of fuel. |
| Fuel Tanks   | Fuel tanks store fuel and supply it to power plants. |
| Coolers      | Coolers provide Cooling to help manage heat generated by other components. |
| Weapons      | Weapons are for breaking things, like hostile mechs. |
| Equipment    | Mech equipment that isn't a weapon. Includes a variety of tools, storage devices, and other bits and bobs. |
