            <h2>Planning a Mech Build</h2>
            <p>
                The first step in building your mech is planning. Typically you want to have an 
                idea of how you want your mech to feel. Up-close brawler mechs will feel very 
                different from mid-range gunners or long-range snipers. Think about how you want 
                to play -- and how that relates to your pilot's personality.
