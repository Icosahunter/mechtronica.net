                    <h2>Planning a Mech Build</h2>
                    <p>
                        The first step in building your mech is planning. Typically you want to have an 
                        idea of how you want your mech to feel. Up-close brawler mechs will feel very 
                        different from mid-range gunners or long-range snipers. Think about how you want 
                        to play -- and how that relates to your pilot's personality.
