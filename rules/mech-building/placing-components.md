## Placing Components
Different components have different limitations as to what slots they can be placed in, like so:
 - **Attachments**: Weapons and other attachments can be placed anywhere in your mechâ€™s frame. 
 - **Other Components**: Power plants, coolers, CPUs, and cabins can only go in the torso.
 - **Modules**: Modules are installed in your cabin and give certain passive abilities. You can have as many modules as your cabin has mod slots.
