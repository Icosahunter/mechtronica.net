## Planning a Mech Build
The first step in building your mech is planning. Typically you want to have an 
idea of how you want your mech to feel. Up-close brawler mechs will feel very 
different from mid-range gunners or long-range snipers. Think about how you want 
to play -- and how that relates to your pilot's personality.

Once you have an idea of how you want to play, you should select a Power Type.
Read on for how Power Type affects your mech.

#### The Power Subsystem
Every mech requires a steady supply of power to keep running. The Power subsystem supplies that power.

The Power subsystem consists of two components: a **Power Plant** and a **Fuel Tank**. The Power Plant uses fuel from the Fuel Tank to generate a steady supply of energy. In order to have a working mech, you'll need a Plant that generates enough Power to feed all of your **constant draw** components. And if you want to use any other **attachments** - like weapons - you'll need enough **excess** power to supply those too.

There are three types of power systems you can build into your mech: Mechanical,
Electrical, and Steam.

##### Power Type and Combat Range
Mech play style varies quite a bit with Power Type. Mechanical mechs tend have short-range weaponry while Electrical mechs tend to have the longest range.

| Power Type  | Range                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Mechanical  | Close range (50 ft to 600 ft) |
| Steam       | Mid range (50 ft to 900 ft)   |
| Electrical  | Long range (200 ft to 900 ft) |
