## Planning a Mech Build
The first step in building your mech is planning. Typically you want to have an 
idea of how you want your mech to feel. Up-close brawler mechs will feel very 
different from mid-range gunners or long-range snipers. Think about how you want 
to play -- and how that relates to your pilot's personality.
