## Planning a Mech Build
The first step in building your mech is planning. Typically you want to have an 
idea of how you want your mech to feel. Up-close brawler mechs will feel very 
different from mid-range gunners or long-range snipers. Think about how you want 
to play -- and how that relates to your pilot's personality.

Once you have an idea of how you want to play, you should select a Power Type.
Read on for how Power Type affects your mech.

### The Power Subsystem
Every mech requires a steady supply of power to keep running. The Power subsystem supplies that power.

The Power subsystem consists of two components: a **Power Plant** and a **Fuel Tank**. The Power Plant uses fuel from the Fuel Tank to generate a steady supply of energy. In order to have a working mech, you'll need a Plant that generates enough Power to feed all of your **constant draw** components. And if you want to use any other **attachments** - like weapons - you'll need enough **excess** power to supply those too.

There are three types of power systems you can build into your mech: Mechanical,
Electrical, and Steam. Since almost all components in your mech must use the same power
type, it's important to choose the right one.

#### Power Type and Combat Range
Mech play style varies quite a bit with Power Type. Mechanical mechs tend have short-range weaponry while Electrical mechs tend to have the longest range.

| Power Type  | Range                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Mechanical  | Close range (50 ft to 600 ft) |
| Steam       | Mid range (50 ft to 900 ft)   |
| Electrical  | Long range (200 ft to 900 ft) |

### The Mech Frame

#### The Speed Tradeoff
One major tradeoff in mech design is speed. Frame size determines how many slots
you have, and your base speed. Plating determines your health and gives a speed
penalty. This means generally the more firepower and more health your mech has,
the slower it will be. This can be mitigated to some extent with attachments but
not perfectly.
