## Planning a Mech Build
The first step in building your mech is planning. Typically you first want to have an idea of how you want your mech to feel. Up-close brawler mechs will feel very different from mid-range gunners or long-range snipers. Think about how you want to play -- and how that relates to your mechaneer's personality.

Once you have an idea of how you want to play, you should select a Mech Frame and Power Type. Read on for information on how each of these affect your mech.

### Tradeoffs (WIP)

#### Power Type and Weapon Range
Mech play style varies quite a bit with power type. Mechanical mechs tend have short-range weaponry, while Electrical mechs tend to have the longest range. Steam-powered mechs have access to both short-range blunt force weapons and long-range artillery, so they're sort of a jack-of-all-trades.

| Power Type  | Range                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Mechanical  | Close range (50 ft to 600 ft) |
| Steam       | Mid range (50 ft to 900 ft)   |
| Electrical  | Long range (200 ft to 900 ft) |

### Step by step Mech-Building Outline

1. Develop a vision for your mechaneer and mech
    - Come up with a name and background for your mechaneer
    - Decide what you want to focus your mech on (heavy weapons, speed, etc.)
2. Choose a Frame
    - Smaller mechs are faster and often don't need auxiliary cooling
    - Larger mechs have much more firepower
3. Choose your mech's main weapons and attachments
    - Find a some weapons and equipment that fit your vision
    - Choose a power type that lets you get most of the weapons and equipment you want
    - Don't worry about filling all your slots here, just pick a couple must-haves
4. Add the control subsystem
    - Choose a mainframe that provides enough processing for your weapons and frame, plus a bit extra to spare
    - Choose a cabin compatible with your mainframe's software
5. Add the power subsystem
    - Choose a power plant that provides enough power for your weapons, plus a bit extra to spare
    - Choose a fuel tank for your power plant
6. Check whether you need to add a cooler
    - If you just barely have enough excess cooling to use your weapons and equipment at this point, you probably need to add a cooler
7. Add more weapons and equipment
    - Fill in the remaining slots in your mech with a few more weapons and equipment
8. Add Modules to your Mainframe
    - Select modules that synergize with your mech's capabilities
8. Check your resources and rebalance if needed
    - Compute Available, Used, and Excess resources for Power, Processing, and Cooling
    - If you don't have enough excess resources, consider upgrading infrastructure components or using less chonky weapons and equipment
