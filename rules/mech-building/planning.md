## Planning a Mech Build
The first step in building your mech is planning. Typically you want to have an 
idea of how you want your mech to feel. Up-close brawler mechs will feel very 
different from mid-range gunners or long-range snipers. Think about how you want 
to play -- and how that relates to your pilot's personality.

### The Speed Tradeoff
One major tradeoff in mech design is speed. Frame size determines how many slots
you have, and your base speed. Plating determines your health and gives a speed
penalty. This means generally the more firepower and more health your mech has,
the slower it will be. This can be mitigated to some extent with attachments but
not perfectly.

### Weapon Power Types
Since all components in your mech must use the same power type (with the exeption
of the mainframe) it is important to choose the right power type for your mech
build. The most important generalization of power types is for weapons:
 - Mechanical: Close range
 - Steam: Mid range
 - Electrical: Long range
