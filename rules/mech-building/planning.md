## Planning a Mech Build
The first step in building your mech is planning. Typically you want to have an 
idea of how you want your mech to feel. Up-close brawler mechs will feel very 
different from mid-range gunners or long-range snipers. Think about how you want 
to play -- and how that relates to your pilot's personality.

Once you have an idea of how you want to play, you should select a Mech Frame and Power
Type. Read on for information on how each of these affect your mech.

### The Mech Frame
The **Frame** is the foundation of your mech. It provides the superstructure you'll attach
your weapons and components to, as well as the moving parts and power distribution system.
Each frame has a number of slots for installing components.

#### The Speed Tradeoff
Frames come in three basic sizes: **Light**, **Standard**, and **Heavy**. Frame size 
determines how many slots you have and your base speed. Light mechs have the fewest 
slots, but move the fastest. Heavy mechs have a plethora of slots, but move at a crawl. 
This generally means that the more firepower your mech has, the slower it will be. 

### The Power Subsystem
Every mech requires a steady supply of **Power** to keep running. The power subsystem 
supplies that power.

The power subsystem consists of two components: a **Power Plant** and a **Fuel Tank**. 
The power plant uses fuel from the fuel tank to generate a steady supply of energy. In 
order to have a working mech, you'll need a plant that generates enough power to feed all 
of your **constant draw** components. And if you want to use any other **attachments** - 
like weapons - you'll need enough **excess** power left over to supply those too.

There are three types of power systems you can build into your mech: Mechanical,
Electrical, and Steam. Since almost all components in your mech must use the same power
type, it's important to choose the right one.

#### Power Type and Weapon Range
Mech play style varies quite a bit with power type. Mechanical mechs tend have 
short-range weaponry, while Electrical mechs tend to have the longest range. Steam-powered
mechs have access to both short-range Blunt Force weapons and long-range artillery, so
they're sort of a jack-of-all-trades.

| Power Type  | Range                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Mechanical  | Close range (50 ft to 600 ft) |
| Steam       | Mid range (50 ft to 900 ft)   |
| Electrical  | Long range (200 ft to 900 ft) |
