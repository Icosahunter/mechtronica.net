## Maintenance Overview

Maintenance is the act of repairing your mech after taking damage. Maintenance uses "Maintenance Power" (abbreviated as "MP") to track how much maintenance you can do in a turn. You perform maintenance using a toolkit, and that toolkit will give you some amount of MP. There are two main types of toolkits and they have different use cases:

**Hand Toolkit**
Hand toolkits are simply toolboxes filled with many hand tools you might need for performing maintenance on mechs. These used to perform maintenance by hand, usually on your own mech, thus you must be physically at the site of maintenance to use these and you cannot be actively piloting while doing so (hence forfitting your turn for performing maintenance on yourself)

**Attachment Toolkit**
Attachment toolkits are any Equipment component that provides MP, such as manipulators or welding tools. Attachment toolkits cannot be used to perform maintenance on the mech they are installed in, however you don't have to forfit your turn to use them. These are helpful for salvaging and for "medic" type mech builds.

### Maintenance Locations
Repairing and tinkering with your mech in the field are an integral part of mechaneering. How repairs work will depend somewhat on your location:
 - **Garages**: While at a garage, maintenance does not consume Maintenance Power.
 - **In the Field**: Repairs may be made by expending Maintenance Power.
 - **Maintenance on Yourself During Turn-Based Play**: You may choose to give up your actions and movement to do maintenance equal to the item toolkit you are using. Plating cannot be self repaired during turn-based play.
 - **Maintenance on Others During Turn-Based Play**: You may use one or more attachment toolkits to do repairs on other mechs without sacrificing your turn. The amount of repairs you can do is equal to the sum of the MP of the attachment toolkits you choose to use.

**Note on Maintenance Out of Turn-Based Play**
 It is important to note that when not in turn based play MP is still used but without the time crunch it is a little less critical. One of your toolkits must have enough MP to perform the maintenance, so if you need to do something that takes 30MP and all your toolkits provide less than 30MP, you cannot do that maintenance. This doesn't preclude you from performing maintance that can be done incrementally, namely repairing plating; since plating only costs 5MP per shield point you only need a toolkit with at least 5MP to repair all your shielding completely out of turn based play.

### Other Maintenance Tasks
There are also some other important mechanics related to maintenance, including:
 - **Disassembling**: A large component yields 2 spare parts and a small component yields 1 spare part. The spare parts will be of the power type of the component being disassembled. When disassembling mainframes you always get electric spare parts. When disassembling cabins you get any modules installed in it.
 - **Salvaging**: You may salvage components in the field, which is like uninstalling them but with a chance of failure. The MP costs are 10MP for small components and 20MP for large. Roll 1d4. On a 1 the component is destroyed. On a 2 or 3 it is damaged. On 4 it is intact. You must use an attachment toolkit for salvaging.
