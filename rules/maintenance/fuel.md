## Fuel
Fuel is stored in tanks and is used on a per-day basis.
At the end of every day you use fuel equal to your {% keyword "Used Resources" glossary %} for power.
If you are using more than one fuel and/or power plant this is a little more complicated, see [Multiple Power Plants]({{site_url}}/rules/multiple-power-plants/).

### Fuel Types
There are 5 fuel types which are roughly on a scale of power density/efficiency from least power dense at the top to most power dense at the bottom:

- Hydrogen
- Lithium Ion
- Ethanol
- Methane
- Nuclear

### Fuel Costs
Below are recommended fuel costs per unit for each planet and fuel type.
These are based on how inhabited the planet is and how easily accessible each fuel type is on that planet.

| Planet    | Hydrogen | Lithium Ion | Ethanol | Methane | Nuclear |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
