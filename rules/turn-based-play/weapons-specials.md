## Weapons Specials
Ah... weapon specials.
Those fun little things that make already destructive tools all the more devastating.
Weapon specials provide extra mechanics that enhance (or sometimes decrease) your weapons effectiveness.
Here is a list of all standard weapon specials and what they do:

| Special    | Description                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| EMP        | If a mech is hit with an EMP weapon in a 
               place where their shields are  destroyed, 
               the mech loses its next turn.             |
| Piercing   | This weapon goes through shields.         |
