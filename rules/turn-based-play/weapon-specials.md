## Weapons Specials
Ah... weapon specials. Those fun little things that make already destructive tools all the more devastating. Weapon specials provide extra mechanics that enhance (or sometimes decrease) your weapons effectiveness.
Here is a list of all standard weapon specials and what they do:

| Special   | Effect |
| --------- | ------ |
| EMP       | If this weapon hits in a place where their shields are destroyed, the mech loses its next turn. |
| Stagger   | After this weapon hits a mech, that mech takes an extra 2 dmg per hit for the remainder of this playerâ€™s turn. |
| Blade     | If this weapon hits a non-joint slot on a limb, you may instead choose to hit a joint slot. |
| Unstable  | You may not fire this weapon and move in the same turn. |
| Overheat  | A successful hit on the opponent increases their used heat capacity for their next turn by 10. |
| Overclock | You may choose prior to firing to make a PWR saving throw where you must roll above 10. If you succeed the weapon will do double damage, if you fail the weapon becomes damaged. |
| Explosive | After impact the projectile explodes, immediately breaking the component hit. |
| Leech     | Fires large latching rounds that deal 2 damage each turn after the hit. Rounds can be removed for 10MP each. |
| Grab      | If you successfully hit a mech's limb, you may prevent that mech from using attachments in that limb or from using its normal alotted movement on its next turn as long as you stay within 50ft of the mech. |
