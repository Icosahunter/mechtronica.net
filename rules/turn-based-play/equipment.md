## Equipment
Equipment includes any attachments that aren't weapons. They work similarly to weapons since they are attachments and are excess draw components. They do, however, have a few special rules.

### Equipment Use
**Turn Based Use**: equipment can be used during turn based play, in which case it counts towards your Excess Resource use just like weapons during your turn.

**Continuous Use of Equipment**: equipment may be used “continuously” in non-turn-based game play. In that case your mech consumes fuel equal to your Used Power and the equipment's power cost combined per day. You can divide this by 12 to determine hourly fuel cost.

### Equipment Traits
Equipment traits are like weapon specials for equipment! Weather you're repairing, hauling, or doing science, there's sure to be an equipment trait for you. Below is a table listing all the basic traits:
| Trait       | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Toolkit     | For performing maintenance on other mechs, value listed in MP. See [Making Repairs](({{site.url}}/rules/making-repairs)) for details on their use. |
| Manipulator | For fine manipulation of objects (mechs have next to zero fine manipulation normally), value listed in percentage chance of success. |
| Jump        | For jumping (mechs normally cannot jump appreciably), value listed in foot-tons (divide by your mech’s weight to get jump height). |
| Boost       | For extra movement in a straight line, value listed in foot-tons (divide by your mech’s weight to get boost distance). |
| Mining      | For mining minerals, value listed in kilograms of ore per hour (thus this is mostly for continuous equipment use). |
| Cargo       | For storing items, works the same as cabin cargo space, value listed in number of items it can store. |
| Winching    | For pulling or hoisting objects, value listed in tons that it can winch. Winching cables have a length of around 100ft, and take about 3 turns to retract from being fully extended. Winches only consume resources if you are actively paying out or retracting the line. You cannot winch more than your mech’s weight. |
| Shield      | For temporary extra shields, value listed in shield points, when used player chooses a section (this may be a section of a nearby mech, within melee range in which case the shielding goes away if the nearby mech leaves melee range), that section has a second layer of shields equal to listed value until the beginning of the player's next turn. When a shield's shield points are depleted, any extra damage is absorbed by the shield collapsing. Other attacks before the player's next turn are handled normally. |
| Analysis    | For analysing samples, value is a list of different material properties the equipment can analyze. |
