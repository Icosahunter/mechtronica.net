                    <h2>Turn Structure</h2>
                    <p>
                        On your turn you have a few options. You can either:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Take a normal turn consisting of using attachments and moving.</li>
                            <li>Perform self maintenance.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Normal Turn</h3>
                    <p>
                        In a normal turn you can use as many attachments as you have resources for.
                        Each attachment can only be used once in a turn.
                        You may also move up to your movement speed.
                        You can do these in any order and movement does not have to be done all at once.
                        Thus, you may move, attack, and retreat, this allows for many different strategies on the battlefield.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Self Maintenance</h3>
                    <p>
                        Self maintenance is... uh, maintenance on yourself.
                        This is as opposed to maintenance on other mechs using attachment toolkits.
                        For details on maintenance see the <a>Maintenance Section</a>.
