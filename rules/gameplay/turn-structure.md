## Turn Order
The player who took the first shot always goes first, then any players on foot take their turns before mechs move. Turn order is as follows:

1. The player who initiated combat takes their turn.
2. All players on foot take their turns, in order from highest to lowest agility.
3. All players in mechs take their turns, in order from highest to lowest speed.

Ties can be broken however the GM wants.

## Turn Structure
On your turn you have a few options. You can either:
- Take a normal turn consisting of using attachments and moving.
- Perform self maintenance.

#### Normal Turn
In a normal turn you may perform any of the following:
- Use as many attachments as you have resources for. Each attachment can only be used once in a turn.
- Move up to your movement speed.

You can do these in any order and movement does not have to be done all at once. Thus, you may move, attack, and retreat. This allows for many different strategies on the battlefield.

#### Self Maintenance
Self maintenance is... uh, maintenance on yourself. This is as opposed to maintenance on other mechs using attachment toolkits.
For details on maintenance see [Maintenance]({{site.url}}/rules/maintenance).
