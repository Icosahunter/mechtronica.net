### What is Mechtronica?
Mechtronica is a tabletop RPG set in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi universe focusing heavily on mechs, large bipedal piloted robots. At the heart of Mechtronica is mech building, most of the rules center around how you build a functional mech and we strive to make it feel both highly customizable and yet constrained in pseudo-realistic ways.

### Status
Mechtronica is currently in **Public Beta**. The rules are complete and everything you need to play is available on this website. However some numbers may still need fine tuning, the lore is a little lacking in content, and some minor rules may change. We would love any feedback you may have; you can email us at [feedback@mechtronica.net](mailto:feedback@mechtronica.net) or submit an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mechtronica/mechtronica.net/issues). You can also share feedback, ask questions, or just share mecha-memes on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/pgJV39T7).

### A Quick Note on the Rules
The rules presented on this website assume some prior knowledge of typical TTRPGs. This may be cleaned up in the future, but for now if you're brand new to this type of game you should read up on them a bit before you try to dive into the rules here. [This article](https://howtogm.guide/basics/intro-to-tabletop-roleplaying-games) is a pretty good basic introduction to the core concepts of tabletop RPGs.
