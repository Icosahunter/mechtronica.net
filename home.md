### What is Mechtronica?
Mechtronica is a table top RPG set in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi universe focusing heavily on mechs, large bipedal piloted robots. At the heart of Mechtronica is mech building, most of the rules center around how you build a functional mech and we strive to make it feel both highly customizable and yet constrained in pseudo-realistic ways.

### Status
Mechtronica is currently in **Public Beta**. The rules are complete and everything you need to play is available on this website. However some numbers may still need fine tuning, the lore is a little lacking in content, and some minor rules may change. We would love any feedback you may have; you can email us at [feedback@mechtronica.net](mailto:feedback@mechtronica.net) or submit an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mechtronica/mechtronica.net/issues). You can also share feedback, ask questions, or just share mecha-memes on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/pgJV39T7).
