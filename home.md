## What is Mechtronica?
Mechtronica is a table top RPG set in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi universe focusing heavily on mechs, large bipedal piloted robots. At the heart of Mechtronica is mech building, most of the rules center around how you build a functional mech and we strive to make it feel both highly customizable and yet constrained in pseudo-realistic ways.

## Status
Mechtronica is currently in development and this website is not yet complete. We hope to have this finished very soon so the system can be publicly available for testing and feedback.
