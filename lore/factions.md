## Factions
Since the end of the war, corporations have become the main sources of political power. Though local governments often exist, they are usually beholden to, or even started by, the corporate power with the most presence in that area. Pushing back against this corporate dominance are the many rebellions, big and small, scattered throughout the system.

### Corporate Powers
| Name                    | Description |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| Protos Industries       | Protos has been around almost as long as mech’s themselves. This long history has given them an impressive presence in the market, and political influence to match. |
| The Industrial Group    | A huge collection of manufacturers that pushes against many of the political reforms and unions in an attempt to protect the dominance of their economic powers. |
| Ter Threpnicus Alliance | Originally a religious group, Ter Threpnicus’ history is shrouded with turmoil. Today the alliance has a complicated, sometimes unclear, political stance, and deadly state-of-the-art weapons, making them a terrifyingly unpredictable force. |
| Moscow Combine | A small group of elite corporations headed by Moscow Instruments, the Moscow Combine is not known for playing nice. |
| Arch Guild | A collection of corporations that seek to bring back reputability to the mech-manufacturer profession. Despite their seemingly virtuous intentions, the guild is rumored to engage in back-stabbing, corporate espionage, and other foul play if it at all helps to improve the public image of the guild and the profession. |

### Rebellions
| Name                    | Description |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| New Factor | One of the larger rebellions, New Factor works through corporate espionage, strategic strikes, and other carefully planned force to bring down corporate powers and establish order under their flag. |
| Star of Cheilos | A spread out, but tightly bonded rebellion, the Star of Cheilos sees restoring peace and new order to Cheilos as their moral duty. |
| Reform Conglomerate | The Reform Conglomerate is an amalgamation of many smaller rebellions from throughout the system that seeks to bring things a little bit closer to the way they were. The reform backs many different unions, and sometimes aids rebellions like New Factor, though they do so discreetly and carefully as their main goal is to improve the lives and power of the working class, not cause chaos. |
| Hand | A cult of Golden Age technology. They seek to overthrow corporate governments and bring about “a new Golden Age” -- by whatever means necessary. |
