## Intro

Many years ago, humanity reached out from the planet Cheilos, exploring the many worlds of the Ilythia system. It was a time of peace, good harvests, and scientific leaps. Humanity spread throughout the system, scattering across the habitable planets and moons. Backed by the competing governments of Cheilos, explorers pushed the frontier, using great machines to create new ways of life. These machines were mechs, massive metal exoskeletons which were given to pioneers to aid them in establishing their homesteads. This was the Golden Age of mankind — but it couldn’t last.

The nations of Cheilos, flush with newfound resources brought back from the frontiers, sought to crush their enemies. Mechs were weaponized for battle: the beginning of the Great War. Machines of war, the likes of which had never before been seen, were born from the foundries of the corporations in support of government armies. The War left the system in desolation so deep that it has yet to recover.

What was once a struggle between nation-states is now a struggle between economic powers, rebellious splinter groups, and those trying to eke out a living in the midst of it all. The corporations dominate the political power structure, constantly fighting for power among the remaining cities of the Ilythia system. Rebellions live in the outskirts, raiding and seizing power wherever they can take it. Occasionally you may come across a withered old pioneer who survived the Great War, living on the dirt their forefathers claimed.

The Ilythia system is not a kind place. You will encounter few people who are willing to give you a helping hand, and many who wish to take what little you have — even if it means killing you. Don’t forget your mech. You’ll need it.
